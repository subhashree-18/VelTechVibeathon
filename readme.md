# Institutional Event Resource Management System (IERMS)

## Overview
IERMS is a role-based platform for managing college events that share venues and institutional resources. It ensures conflict-free scheduling, strict approval workflows, and real-time resource tracking.

## Problem
Parallel events often cause venue clashes and resource overbooking. Manual coordination lacks visibility and control.

## Solution
The system provides multi-level approvals, capacity validation, dynamic allocation, and role-specific dashboards to maintain consistent and fair resource usage.
